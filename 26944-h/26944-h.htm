<h2>THE MAGIC SOAP PIPE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Ned</span> had been reading a very interesting
book about fairies and goblins, and how
these real queer little folk inhabit dense
forests and lofty mountain caves and lead
a wonderful life apart from the homes
and cities of men.</div>

<p>The book was very large and heavy, and
the afternoon was very warm, and the big
armchair in which he was curled up was
so comfortable that by and by he let the
book slip to one side.</p>

<p>He had just closed his eyes for a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to rest them, when he was startled
by a little squeaky voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes with a start and
saw a Gnome standing on the window-sill
just in front of him. Yes, there was no
mistake about it, it was a Gnome. For
had not Ned a moment before seen his picture
in the big book he had been reading?
Indeed, it almost seemed as if the picture
itself had stepped out of the page from
between the covers, so exactly a duplicate
did the little man appear.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ned!" said the little squeaky
voice again. "I say, hello! You ought
to know me well enough by this time to
answer, since you've been reading about
me for the last hour."</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself!" replied Ned, laughing
in spite of himself, and rubbing his
eyes again to make sure that it was not
a picture from the book.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/i_015.png" width="252" height="500" alt="Sleeping" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Can't you see a fellow is sleepy after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
reading so long a time? I didn't think
you were coming out of the book to speak
to me, you know."</p>

<p>"Neither did I," retorted the Gnome,
with a funny wink. "I came from the
forest to invite you to take a little journey
with me through Gnomeland. I am
the King of the Gnomes, and my subjects
have told me how interested you are in
reading about us, so I have come to take
you for a trip through our kingdom. I
know you will love to see all the wonderful
things you have been reading about.
Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I will," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Then follow me," replied the Gnome.</p>

<p>Ned jumped through the window after
the little fellow, who ran swiftly down the
walk and across the fields to the forest
beyond.</p>

<p>As they neared the brook that ran
through the meadow, the Gnome paused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Taking from his pocket a clay pipe, he
stooped over and filled it with water.</p>

<p>"Did you ever blow soap bubbles?" he
asked, taking a piece of soap from another
pocket and rubbing it carefully
around the inside of the pipe-bowl.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Ned, "lots of times."</p>

<p>"Well, you wait and see what sort of
a bubble I'll blow," replied the Gnome.</p>

<p>It was a bubble! But the strangest
part of it all was that Ned found himself
inside of it with his companion.</p>

<p>"How did we get inside, or how did the
bubble get around us?" asked Ned, but
before his question was answered away
went the bubble up in the air, across the
meadow, above the little brook, yes, over
the roof of his own house, higher and
higher, until finally it reached the big high
mountain that he had so often dimly seen
from the window of his bedroom at home.</p>

<p>After circling about the highest peak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the bubble at length safely landed on a
rocky ledge.</p>

<p>Before Ned could ask how they were
ever going to get out the Gnome opened
a little door through which he led him to
the outer air.</p>

<p>There was a great change in the temperature,
or else the inside of the bubble
was very warm, for Ned began to shiver
and shake. "Who-o-!" he cried; "it's
co-old!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Look," answered the
Gnome, and Ned's eyes, following the
pointing finger of his little friend, fell
upon a strange and terrifying figure.</p>

<p>Behind a bank of icicles stood a giant,
with an immense helmet upon his head,
from which hung long sharp pieces of ice.
The top part was covered with snow which
slipped off at intervals like a small avalanche
to the ground below. His beard
and mustache were festooned with thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
slivers of ice, and his shoulders bore
epaulets of frosted snow. The cuffs of
his greatcoat were fringed with snowflakes,
and altogether he was a startling
and frigid looking individual. In his
hands he held a monstrous bellows, from
which he forced out a blast of icy air
which, scattering the snow in whirling
clouds, went howling down the rocky
ravines.</p>

<p>"He's the Wind Man of the Mountain,"
explained the Gnome, turning to shivering
Ned, whose toes and fingers by this
time were quite numb with the cold.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to meet a Hot Air Man,"
said Ned, blowing on his hands to keep
them from freezing. "I'd like to feel
warm again."</p>

<p>"Well, then follow me!" cried the
Gnome, and turning to a big rock he
tapped upon it twice with the toe of his
little red boot. In a moment a door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
opened, showing a pair of rocky steps
leading down into the mountain.</p>

<p>"Be careful," admonished the Gnome,
as he and Ned descended the rough flight.
"Don't slip, for you might fall a long
way."</p>

<p>Ned assured him he had no desire to
fall, but that his feet were so numb he
wasn't at all sure but what he might slip,
no matter how hard he tried to be careful.</p>

<p>Although it was not exactly dark, at the
same time the light was not sufficient for
Ned to make out anything distinctly, and
as the stairway was narrow and the walls
dim he kept his eyes closely upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a level corridor and
he perceived a dim light in the distance.
"Where are we going?" he asked. But
at this point an iron door arrested their
progress, and without pausing to answer,
the Gnome took from his pocket a key.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Inserting it in the lock, the door slowly
swung open, and Ned heard the faint
beating of a drum.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the Gnome, drawing
forward a wooden stool, much too small
for Ned, but probably just the right size
for a Gnome; "sit down and wait a moment
while I go in search of the Gnomeland
Band. I want you to hear them
play, and I hear them practising now."</p>

<p>Ned glanced curiously around the
strange place. It suddenly occurred to
him that he was a long, long way from
home. Here he was, deep down in the
mountain, in a rocky cavern, sitting on a
little Gnome stool, waiting for his friend
to return. But what if he did not come
back?</p>

<p>Ned's hair suddenly stood on end at the
thought. Going over to the big iron door,
he tried to turn the great knob, but his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fingers either were not strong enough or
he did not know the secret of the lock.
Returning to his seat, he made up his
mind to wait a while before allowing his
fears to get the better of him. This is
what every brave boy would do under the
circumstances, he said to himself, resolving
not to be a coward.</p>

<p>Presently he was relieved to hear
music, as the Gnome, at the head of the
Gnomeland Band, came into view; and
the funniest band that Ned had ever seen.
Why, each instrument was playing itself
and dancing the Mountain Tango at the
same time!</p>

<p>The big drum went "Bum, bum, bum,
diddle dum," and pranced around on a
pair of short, fat legs in red stockings.
Two fat little arms beat the drumsticks
on the top of his head, or what appeared
to be the top of his head, which was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reality a funny face, which winked and
blinked as the drumsticks traveled over
the queer little features.</p>

<p>"Toot! toot!" went the big yellow horn,
as his fat little fingers pressed in the brass
stops that made the notes high or low, or
soft or shrill. Over the floor he skipped,
after the round, fat drum.</p>

<p>The 'cello and the violin came next.
The latter ran his bow across his stringed
waistcoat in perfect time, while the former
twanged the strings that covered his
happy face in a jolly fashion. The rest
of the band played on themselves beautifully,
and the Gnome, with his baton,
proved a most capable leader. In fact,
the music was so delightful that Ned
finally could restrain himself no longer,
and, jumping up, began dancing around
to the tune of "For He's a Jolly Good
Fellow!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Heigh-ho! hey diddle-do!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Down in the mountain deep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fiddle and drum, tiddle-dy-um,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Are doing the Leopard Leap!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Just then the music stopped, or, rather,
the Musical Instruments paused to take
breath, and Ned sat down again, wondering
what next would happen. In a few
minutes the round, fat drum commenced
to beat "Left, right! left, right!" and
the Gnomeland Band fell into line and
marched slowly down the long cavern until
it was out of sight.</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC CAKE</h2>

<div class='center'>Ned and the Gnome landed safely on a big soft
bunker of moss.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_029.png" width="400" height="250" alt="Ned and the Gnome landed safely on a big soft  bunker of moss." title="" />
</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC CAKE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">As</span> the last drum beat died away in the
distance, the Gnome turned to Ned and
said: "Come, let us hasten, for I am
rather hungry, and you no doubt are in
need of nourishment also."</div>

<p>Ned obeyed willingly, for he had tasted
nothing since breakfast and was now as
hungry as a healthy youngster should be.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the cavern was
an inclined plane, very much like the
chutes at Coney Island.</p>

<p>Carefully seating Ned at his side the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Gnome said: "Now hold tight, and hold
your breath and hold your tongue&mdash;in
fact, hold everything you've got&mdash;for we
are going to take a swift shoot to the bottom
of the mountain and you'll find out
what the word swift means if you never
have before!"</p>

<p>At this they began to move, and in another
moment they were traveling as fast
as a bullet from a gun.</p>

<p>The wind, whistling by, cut Ned's
cheeks like little sharp needles; his hair
stood out behind like feathers on a speeding
arrow.</p>

<p>They were going so fast it was almost
impossible to breathe.</p>

<p>Presently a tiny light appeared in the
distance, and he saw that they were now
on a level, although still going at a tremendous
rate of speed.</p>

<p>In another moment they shot through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the little round hole of light, which turned
out to be the opening at the other end,
and he and the Gnome landed safely on
a big soft bunker of moss in the midst of
a beautiful forest.</p>

<p>Birds were singing in the treetops and
little rabbits were skipping on the soft carpet
of the woodland.</p>

<p>Pretty flowers sent forth a delicious
perfume and a brook close at hand rippled
over the pebbly bottom of its bed.</p>

<p>"Wait," cried the Gnome, as Ned
leaned over to drink the cool water.
"Wait; I have for you the most delicious
drink if you will restrain your impatience
a moment longer."</p>

<p>Ned obeyed and followed the Gnome
along a narrow path until they came to a
small clearing, where the blue sky smiled
down upon them.</p>

<p>In the center of the spot was a monstrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
watermelon, standing up on end,
the thick vine supporting it like a strong
round barrel stave.</p>

<p>A large wooden spigot protruded from
one side and over it leaned a Gnome, who
had climbed upon the vine in order to
reach the handle.</p>

<p>Ned's little companion lifted a goblin
cup to catch the drops of delicious looking
pink juice which began to drip slowly
from the spigot when the Gnome carefully
turned the handle.</p>

<p>"Careful, now," commanded the
Gnome, as he handed the brimming goblet
to Ned. "See that you spill not a drop
of the precious nectar.</p>

<p>"Good, is it?" he inquired, seeing the
sparkle in Ned's eyes and hearing the
smack on his lips as the last drop disappeared.
"Pretty good, eh?"</p>

<p>"Better'n soda water," replied Ned;
"lots better."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Gnome at the spigot smiled.
"I grew the melon," he said with pride.
"It's the largest so far in Gnomeland.
But next year I'm going to grow even a
bigger one!"</p>

<p>"How do you make them grow so
large?" inquired Ned, hoping he would
be invited to have another glass of the
juice.</p>

<p>"Not another drop!" said Ned's little
friend. "A second goblet and you would
be so hungry you could eat stones."</p>

<p>"Come with me," said the small Gnome
guide. "We must eat."</p>

<p>Ned eagerly followed him, and they
pressed forward at a rapid walk until
they came to a queer little hut, from which
issued a most delicious odor of sponge
cake.</p>

<p>Around the door, or, more properly,
what appeared to be one, but which was
in fact but a small opening, stood several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
goblins, evidently awaiting orders from
someone.</p>

<p>As Ned drew near he perceived that instead
of a hut it was in reality a huge
oven, in which something very delicious
was being baked.</p>

<p>"Minions!" called out Ned's friend, "is
not the goblin cake ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire!" responded several voices,
and in another moment the oven was
taken apart and removed from the most
delicious looking sponge cake that Ned
had ever seen. A soft, warm brown color
made it most tempting to the eyes, and
the delicious smell made Ned so anxious to
commence eating that he could with
difficulty restrain himself.</p>

<p>"Help yourself," cried his little friend,
and without a moment's hesitation Ned
pulled off a piece of cake and eagerly
commenced.</p>

<p>"Begone!" commanded the Gnome to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the small bakers, who still stood around
curiously watching their cake disappearing
down the mouth of a mortal as rapidly
as its owner could cram it in; "begone and
leave us to enjoy the cake alone!"</p>

<p>At this they turned away and descended
the steep hill which lay to the right and
disappeared below.</p>

<p>"Be careful," admonished the Gnome,
as Ned showed no signs of finishing, "you
may eat too much. Gnome cake, while
most delicious, is more filling than that
of mortal make!"</p>

<p>But Ned paid no heed. Already he had
eaten a great hole in the cake and, finding
the inside warm and flaky, he squeezed
himself in.</p>

<p>It was much easier to eat the inside, as
it was softer, and the crust had already
grown quite hard.</p>

<p>He was so busy eating and, I'm sorry
to say, so greedy, that he did not notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that as he ate away the interior of the
sponge cake the outside gradually grew
tighter, and the opening which he had
made at the beginning of his feast, and
through which he had crowded, became
smaller and smaller, until finally it closed
altogether.</p>

<p>When Ned perceived this, and it was
some time after, I assure you, he was indeed
frightened. He pounded on the
walls of his sponge cake prison and called
loudly to the Gnome, but for some time
he heard nothing.</p>

<p>Finally, after frantically running
around and around inside the huge cake
ball, he thought he heard the voice of his
small friend. He pressed his ear close
to the wall and listened.</p>

<p>Sure enough, he could just hear the
words, "Hold on tight to one side, and
brace your feet," and the next moment he
perceived that the cake was in motion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly at first, but in a few minutes the
great cake ball began to revolve faster
and faster.</p>

<p>Ned was terrified at first, as it was with
great difficulty that he kept his body from
playing battledore and shuttlecock. The
greater the speed of the huge mass, however,
the less inclination there was to
bounce about, and he soon found himself
literally glued, as it were, to one side.</p>

<p>While thus traveling in this novel way,
he began to entertain some fear as to what
would happen should an obstacle be encountered,
and by some strange coincidence
no sooner had, the idea come than
it was followed by a terrific crash!</p>

<p>The crust of the cake ball broke into a
thousand pieces, and Ned landed safely
some distance from the spot, still clinging
to a huge piece of sponge cake, which
acted like a cushion between him and the
ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking anxiously around, after wiping
some stray crumbs from his eyes, he saw
his little friend, the Gnome, running frantically
down the steep incline, which,
luckily for Ned, had been the cause of his
liberation.</p>

<p>Finding him unhurt, the Gnome sat
down on the piece of cake to rest himself
and regain his breath before speaking.</p>

<p>When he did, however, what he said
caused Ned to run quickly over to the
brook to look at himself in the water.</p>

<p>To his dismay, what the Gnome had said
was, indeed, too true. Ned was nearly as
broad as he was high.</p>

<p>The cake he had eaten had evidently occupied
the same space inside of him as it
had inside the brown crust.</p>

<p>"What am I ever going to do?" said
Ned.</p>

<p>"'Twas a lucky think I kept you from
drinking another gobletful of the watermelon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
juice," answered the Gnome.
"Otherwise you might have eaten the
whole cake, and then you might have been
twice as large as you are now."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is anything to
laugh at," said Ned, as his small friend
burst into a hearty peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," replied the
Gnome, "you can't see yourself. If you
could, though&mdash;oh, my!" and he again
burst into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>Ned waited a few moments and then
asked: "Well, what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Ned, dear," replied his
little friend, touched by his good nature
and feeling sorry for him, "don't worry.
The watermelon juice made the sponge
cake swell. All that is necessary now is
to take the antidote, and I know where it
can be found without any trouble."</p>

</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC NECTAR</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Ned</span> and the Gnome continued their journey
down the valley, following the crystal
stream, in whose waters he had just a
short time before seen his distorted figure,
until they came to a beautiful waterfall,
down whose silvery sheen slid numerous
water sprites and water fairies.</div>

<p>"Over yonder," exclaimed the Gnome,
"lives the Fairy of the Lake. She brews
a magic liquid from checkerberries,
which, I am told, if you but drink a thimbleful,
will enable you to regain your natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shape. There she goes now, over the
bridge, on some such errand I dare say."</p>

<p>Ned watched the fairy stepping across
the silver network which hung above a
miniature Niagara that he could easily
have spanned with a single step. Catching
up a handful of berries he followed
her, not heeding the Gnome's remark
"that she would probably prefer to pick
them herself," and, almost treading on
some of the fairies who were blowing
about in the long grass like the flowers
they represented, threw the berries in a
heap at the door of her castle.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a most beautiful little
palace. Made of brilliant crystals, it
sparkled in the sun like a rainbow. Inside,
it was even more exquisite, for all
her little subjects, the flower fairies and
the woodland fays, had adorned it with
many lovely things.</p>

<p>Ned stooped over and peeped in at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
doorway. There was a bright light inside
which came from a little star suspended
from the ceiling, the crystal walls on all
sides reflecting the light with great brilliancy.
Here and there were draped
beautiful laces, no doubt spun by the
spiders kept by the fairies for that
purpose.</p>

<p>"Come," said the Gnome somewhat impatiently,
as Ned's curiosity still held him
at the little castle's doorway. "Come
away, or else the Queen will not return.
How is she to enter if you block up her
entrance?"</p>

<p>Following his advice, Ned withdrew
some little distance and stood watching
the gay scene around him.</p>

<p>Hundreds of insects were flying about
and large, gay-winged butterflies fluttered
over the flowers. On some he noticed tiny
figures and others with blades of grass
tied around the necks of robins, bluebirds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and golden orioles were also flying about
in mid-air, while some sailed on the silver
backs of fishes or floated in shells upon the
water near his feet.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried the Gnome suddenly,
"here she comes."</p>

<p>A half horsechestnut, with damask
roseleaf cushions, mounted on four ivy-berry
wheels and with four shining beetles
for horses came driving up from the
waterfall.</p>

<p>Leaning back in her carriage sat the
Queen Fairy, fanning her face with a fly's
wing.</p>

<p>The beetles came to a stand in front of
the palace, and the Queen, gathering up
her white satin dress, stepped out.</p>

<p>Instantly numerous ladies in waiting,
jumped from off their butterfly steeds
and escorted her through the palace door.</p>

<p>Ned cautiously peeped in again. The
room was filled with fairies about as large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as your thumb, dancing here and there
and singing a low, sweet song.</p>

<p>On perceiving that a mortal was gazing
at them they began to dance more slowly,
and presently ceased altogether. Whereupon
the Queen, looking about to ascertain
the reason and catching sight of
Ned's admiring face, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"No wonder you feel so faint, my little
fays, and that you stop your merry dancing.
The hot air is pouring in upon us
from a fiery furnace outside. Look here,
my giant friend," she added, coming up
to Ned, "if you want to see how we live
you mustn't hold your mouth open with
astonishment. Your breath is very hot
to us little people!"</p>

<p>With that the mischievous Queen
jumped quite unexpectedly on Ned's nose
and gave it a sharp pinch.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," said the fairy in a cheery
voice, the laughs falling from her like waterdrops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
from the cascade just outside;
"I only wanted to let you know what I
could do; but I am ready to be as polite
as you wish."</p>

<p>"May it please your highness," interposed
the Gnome, who at this point
squeezed himself through Ned's legs and
entered the door, "to give my mortal
friend a drop of your crystal nectar, in
order that he may regain his boyish shape
again?"</p>

<p>The Queen Fairy looked politely inquisitive.</p>

<p>"You see, your highness," the Gnome
went on to explain, "he has eaten too
heartily of gnome cake, and that together
with a gobletful of gnome watermelon
juice, has caused him much inconvenience,
as well as an entire change of form."</p>

<p>No sooner had he finished speaking
than the Queen called the Waterfall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Fairy, the Brook Fairy and yet another,
somewhat smaller, called Violet Water.</p>

<p>"Hasten," she said to them when they
had assembled before her, "hasten to
make a draft of crystal nectar, that this
mortal may drink and assume once more
his natural shape."</p>

<p>"Move off!" cried a shrill voice in Ned's
ear, and, looking up, he saw a Snapdragon,
who seemed to be a sort of policeman
for the fairies.</p>

<p>"How can you expect these Ladies-in-Waiting
to fulfill their Queen's commands
if you stand there blocking the
royal exit?"</p>

<p>"Tell your friend to sit him down and
wait patiently, for it will take some time
to brew the magic draft," said the Queen
to the Gnome, who repeated her words
to Ned.</p>

<p>He was very glad indeed to rest, for,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not being accustomed to carry so much
weight on his young legs, he felt very
weary and somewhat discouraged.</p>

<p>However, relief was in sight, and, following
the suggestion of the good fairy,
he threw himself down on a mossy bank
and waited.</p>

<p>Before long the three fairies returned,
bearing between them a lily filled with a
white liquid.</p>

<p>As they approached the Queen herself
came forth from her crystal palace, followed
by many of her subjects.</p>

<p>Stepping up to where Ned lay, she said
in a soft voice: "Do not rise, for even now
you are much too tall. I myself must
pour this magic nectar upon your lips."</p>

<p>So saying, she stepped lightly upon a
stone close by and, bending forward,
placed the lily to Ned's mouth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/i_051.png" width="374" height="500" alt="&quot;DO NOT RISE,&quot; SAID THE FAIRY QUEEN." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;DO NOT RISE,&quot; SAID THE FAIRY QUEEN.</span>
</div>

<p>The next moment he felt a strange sensation
running through him, and looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
down at his hands and feet was delighted
to see that they were becoming smaller
and smaller.</p>

<p>Though great was his delight, he did not
forget his manners, and, turning to the
little fairy, said: "How may I ever
repay you for your great kindness? Indeed,"
he added, scarcely able to restrain
the tears which came to his eyes, "whatever
would my dear mother have thought
had I returned to her in the form of a
giant?"</p>

<p>"Thank me no more," answered the
Fairy Queen, "for gladly will I do any
favor for the boy who thinks of his mother
first. In the future, should you need my
aid, hang this ring about a bluebird's
throat and send him to me."</p>

<p>And with these words she placed a slender
gold ring upon Ned's little finger.</p>

<p>"But how shall I catch the bird?"
asked Ned, his curiosity aroused before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he had time to think of thanking her small
highness.</p>

<p>"Whistle thrice upon a blade of grass,"
she answered, "and the bird will fly to
thee. Then place the ring about his neck
and bid him hasten to the Fairy Queen
of the Lake."</p>

<p>During all this time Ned had been
growing smaller and smaller. He had almost
forgotten this, when his little friend,
the Gnome, exclaimed: "There! You're
your own self again!" At which Ned
turned to the Queen, and, after thanking
her again ran hastily to the brook to assure
himself that such was the case.</p>

<p>So, bidding farewell to his kind friend,
the Fairy Queen, and her three Ladies-in-Waiting,
he accompanied the Gnome
down the valley.</p>

</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC AXE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Presently</span> the Gnome turned to Ned and
said:</div>

<p>"I must leave you for a time. But
with the Fairy Queen's magic ring upon
your finger, you will be safe from harm.
Self reliance is what all boys should practise.
Therefore, travel for a few days
alone. At the end of that time I will join
you." And with these words the Gnome
disappeared.</p>

<p>For a moment Ned felt a wild desire
to call him back. But with a shrug of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
shoulder, he put away the thought and
bravely set out in search of further
adventure.</p>

<p>He had gone but a short distance when
he came to a Magic Axe, chopping away
all by itself at one of the tallest trees.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mistress Axe," he
said. "Doesn't it tire you to be chopping
away all alone there at that old tree?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, my son. Put me in your
knapsack and I will make you famous."</p>

<p>Picking up the axe, Ned placed it in his
knapsack and set off once more. After a
while, he came to a place where the road
was hollowed out of a mass of solid rock,
and here, in the distance, he heard a sharp
noise like that of iron striking against
stone.</p>

<p>"Some giant must be breaking rocks
away up there," he said to himself, and
climbed up the mountain. When he
reached the top of the high rock, he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a Magic Pickaxe, all alone by itself, digging
away at the hard stone as if it were
soft clay.</p>

<p>Every time that wonderful pickaxe
struck a blow it went more than a foot
into the rock.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mistress Pickaxe,"
said Ned. "Doesn't it tire you to be digging
alone here, hollowing away at that
old rock?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, my little man. Put me in
your knapsack and I will make you
famous."</p>

<p>Ned picked up the pickaxe and placing
it in his knapsack, again went on.</p>

<p>After a while he came to a brook which
he followed up the hillside.</p>

<p>The farther he went the smaller it grew
until finally, it ended in a little nutshell,
from which this tiny stream began its
journey down the mountain.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Spring," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ned. "Doesn't it tire you to be gushing
away all alone by yourself in your little
corner?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it does, my little man. Put
me in your knapsack and I will make you
famous."</p>

<p>Ned picked up the little nutshell and
plugging it up with moss, placed it carefully
in his knapsack with the Magic Axe
and the Magic Pickaxe.</p>

<p>After some little time he came to a
king's palace. Now, although it was a
magnificent palace, everyone living there
was perfectly miserable, for one morning,
without the least warning, an immense
oak had sprung up, with leaves and
branches so thick that they shut out the
sun from all the windows, making the
castle as dark as night.</p>

<p>Of course in those days there was no gas
and electricity, and although the king had
commanded that candles be made as high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
as barber poles, they spluttered and often
went out when the wind blew.</p>

<p>All the woodcutters in the kingdom had
tried to cut down this tree, but its bark
was so tough that it turned the edge of
every axe, and for every branch that was
lopped off, two instantly grew in its place.
At last the king had offered three bags of
gold to anyone who would rid him of his
troublesome oaktree.</p>

<p>Now this was not the only trouble that
beset the poor king. For, although the
surrounding country was rich in springs
and brooks, the royal gardens were dry
as the desert of Sahara. And although
the king had also promised three bags of
gold to anyone who would dig a well, no
one had yet been able to dig deeper than a
foot, as the palace was built on a rock of
solid granite.</p>

<p>Each day the king grew more angry,
but of course that did no good. At last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
calling the poet laureate of his kingdom,
he asked him what should be done.</p>

<p>Running his fingers through his long
curly hair, the poet thought a while.
Then summoning the Royal Carpenter,
ordered him to make an immense placard,
on which, when finished, this wise poet
printed:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"To him who cuts my oaktree down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll give three bags of gold</span><br />
But he who fails shall lose his life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And lie beneath the mold."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"But what good will that exquisite
poem do?" asked the king, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It will keep your Royal Highness
from being irritated by this endless sound
of chop, chop, chop," replied the poet.
"I verily believe every man in your kingdom
has had a hack at the tree. Now, he
who reads this sign, will first make sure
his axe is a good one. And my poetic ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
will be spared much of this frightful noise
which is far worse than a steel rivetter at
work on a ninety story building in New
York City." Which shows that this poet
had an eye that could see into the future,
for at that time, as far as I know, Columbus
hadn't even asked the Queen of Spain
to pawn her diamond rings!</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the king, "have
the sign nailed on this dreadful tree and
we will see what happens."</p>

<p>As soon as Ned arrived at the castle he
bowed politely to the king, who happened
to be standing nearby with all his
courtiers.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha," laughed the king, as Ned
read the sign. "Do you, too, wish to lose
your ears?" At which all the courtiers
laughed heartily, the first time in many
months that anybody in that castle had
laughed, or even smiled, for that matter.</p>

<p>"I can but try," answered Ned bravely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and opening his knapsack, took out his
Magic Axe. Standing it up, with the
handle leaning against the enchanted tree,
he stepped back a few feet and shouted:
"Chop, chop, chop!"</p>

<p>At once the axe began to chop, now
right, now left, and up and down, and in
an incredibly short time that immense
tree was cut to bits. It took only a quarter
of an hour, and yet there was such a
monstrous heap of wood that the whole
court needed nothing else to burn for a
whole year.</p>

<p>But when Ned asked the king for the
three bags of gold, that stingy old monarch
said, "Before I give you the reward,
you must perform another task."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"You must dig me a well so that I may
have plenty of water," answered the king.</p>

</div>



<h2>THE MAGIC SPRING</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">I can</span> but try, your Majesty," said Ned
bravely, and again opening his knapsack,
took out his Magic Pickaxe. Laying it
carefully on the ground in the proper position,
he shouted:</div>

<p>"Pick, pick, pick!"</p>

<p>At once the pick began to burst the
granite to splinters, and in less than a
quarter of an hour had dug a well more
than a hundred feet deep in the solid rock.</p>

<p>"Is the well deep enough, your Majesty?"
asked Ned politely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the king, "but
where is the water to come from?" And
he winked at his courtiers, who smiled to
themselves, for they all thought Ned
would fail, after all, for as yet there
wasn't a drop of water in the well.</p>

<p>But Ned wasn't discouraged. He
quietly opened his knapsack again and
took out the nutshell covered with moss,
and placed it on a magnificent fountain
vase which, not having any water, had
been filled with a beautiful bouquet of
flowers.</p>

<p>"Gush, gush, gush!" he shouted, stepping
aside to avoid a wetting.</p>

<p>At once water began to burst out among
the flowers, singing with a gentle murmur,
and falling down in a sparkling cascade,
that was so cold it made everybody shiver.
And in less than a quarter of an hour the
well was filled, and a deep trench had to
be dug to take away the overflow, otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the whole palace would have been
flooded.</p>

<p>"You have indeed earned the reward,"
said the king. And he ordered a little
donkey saddled and bridled and the six
bags of gold hung from his back, three on
either side. After which Ned was invited
to a great feast, and when that was over,
he mounted the little donkey and rode
away, with the three bags of gold hanging
from each side of the saddle and a little
gold ring on his finger, which the king's
daughter gave him after washing her
pretty face in water for the first time in
many months.</p>

<p>But before Ned rode away, he put his
Magic Axe and his Magic Pickaxe back in
his knapsack, "for who can tell," he said
to himself, "what need I may have of
these two useful tools."</p>

<p>His knapsack was now well filled, for
the cook in the royal kitchen had also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
placed in it a loaf of bread, a cheese and
a knife in case he became hungry while
on his journey of adventure.</p>

<p>As Ned traveled on, the forest became
darker and darker, for the trees grew so
close together that the sun could hardly
shine through the thick leafy roof. Suddenly
he heard a great voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I am the master of this wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And everyone bows to me,</span><br />
My head is as big as a drygoods box<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And my legs as long as a tree."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then, all at once, the voice changed to
a whistle, which sounded like the siren
on a sound steamer when the weather is
foggy.</p>

<p>"It must be a giant singing," thought
Ned. "Goodness! but he's a loud whistler.
I guess he blows through his
fingers!" and he hid beneath a clump of
bushes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried the voice, and a giant
came crashing through the forest.</p>

<p>On seeing Ned, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Come out of there, and I'll make a
mouthful of you."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry," replied Ned
bravely. "I'm going to make you my
servant."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the giant, "that is
a good joke! I'll pitch you into that
raven's nest up there to teach you to make
less noise in my forest."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> forest!" laughed Ned. "It's as
much mine as yours, and if you say another
word, I'll cut it down in a quarter
of an hour."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" shouted the giant, "I should
like to see you begin, my brave Sir Kid!"</p>

<p>Carefully placing his Magic Axe on
the ground, Ned shouted, "Chop, chop,
chop!"</p>

<p>At once the axe began to chop, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
right, now left, and up and down, till the
branches tumbled down on the giant's
head like hail in autumn.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" cried the giant. "Don't
destroy my forest. Who the mischief are
you?"</p>

<p>"Sit down and I'll tell you the story of
the famous Puss in Boots, who once killed
a giant and gave his castle to his Master,
the Lord of Carabas," said Ned.</p>

<p>"How could a cat kill a giant? You
are making sport of me."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Ned. "Have you
never read the story of Puss in Boots?"</p>

<p>"No, but I once heard my cousin, the
Giant of the Beanstalk, speak of a cat who
wore boots. But that was long ago when
we were both boys."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you then," said Ned.
"Puss in Boots' master was the youngest
of three sons. When their father died,
the two older brothers received the farm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and money, while he was left nothing but
a Cat, who said to him one day, 'Do just
what I tell you and I will make you rich.
Give me a bag and a pair of boots, because
the brambles scratch my legs, and you
shall see what I will do for you.'</p>

<p>"Well, when the boots were made and
he had put them on, he hung the bag about
his neck, and set out for a rabbit warren
where lived great numbers of rabbits.
Opening the bag he stretched himself out
as though he were dead, and waited for a
hungry rabbit to poke his nose into the
bag to eat the bran. Pretty soon along
came a young rabbit and as soon as it had
crept in to eat the bran, Puss in Boots
pulled the string, and that was the last of
the little rabbit.</p>

<p>"Then, running off to the palace, he
gave it to the king, saying it was a present
from his master, my Lord of Carabas, the
name he had invented for his young master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Every day he brought some kind of
game, until by and by the king thought my
Lord of Carabas a great man and Puss in
Boots a most wonderful cat, which indeed
he was."</p>

<p>"He was indeed," said the big giant,
moving uneasily on the log on which he
was sitting.</p>

<p>"Well, one day," continued Ned, "Puss
in Boots bade his master bathe in the
river, and leave the rest to him. Just
then the King passed by.</p>

<p>"'Help, help!' cried Puss. 'Robbers
have stolen my master's clothes!'</p>

<p>"At once the king ordered his guards to
the rescue, and fitting out my Lord of
Carabas with a new suit of clothes, invited
him to ride in the coach with his beautiful
daughter.</p>

<p>"As they rolled along they came in sight
of a castle owned by a bad giant."</p>

</div>

<h2>MAGIC FOOD</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Puss in Boots</span>, who had reached the castle
in advance of the royal party, opened
the door and said with a low bow to the
wicked ogre:</div>

<p>"'I hear you have the power to change
yourself into any animal.'</p>

<p>"'That is true,' answered the ogre, so
pleased that at once he turned himself into
a lion.</p>

<p>"'I doubt if you can become as small as
a mouse,' said Puss in Boots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Instantly the ogre changed himself
into a mouse, whereupon Puss in Boots
pounced upon him and ate him up.</p>

<p>"At that moment up drove the coach.
Throwing open the castle door, Puss in
Boots said with a hospitable bow:</p>

<p>"'Welcome to the castle of my Lord of
Carabas.' And, to make a long story
short," laughed Ned, "his master married
the King's daughter and lived happily
ever after."</p>

<p>"Whew!" gasped the giant. "He certainly
was a wonderful cat," and he
looked anxiously at the Magic Axe.</p>

<p>Presently Ned began to feel hungry,
and opening his knapsack, took out his
bread and cheese.</p>

<p>"What is that white stuff?" asked the
giant, who had never seen cheese before.</p>

<p>"That is a stone," answered Ned, commencing
to eat it with a hungry appetite.</p>

<p>"Do you eat stones?" asked the giant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes," answered Ned. "That's my
regular food, which explains why I'm not
so big as you who eat oxen; but it's also
the reason why, little as I am, I am ten
times as strong as you are. Now take me
to your house."</p>

<p>The giant looked at the Magic Axe
which had so nearly destroyed his forest,
and then at Ned eating a stone with apparent
relish.</p>

<p>"I will," he said, and humbly led the
way to his monstrous cabin.</p>

<p>"Now listen," said Ned to the giant
after they were fairly seated, "one of us
must be the master, and the other the servant.
If I can't do whatever you do, I
am to be your slave; if you're not able to
do whatever I do, you are to be mine."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said the giant. "I'd be
tickled to death to have a little servant
like you. It's too much work for me to
think, and you have brains enough for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
both. Well, let's start the trial. Here
are my two buckets,&mdash;go and get the water
to make the soup!"</p>

<p>Ned looked at the buckets, the tops of
which he couldn't even see, for they were
two enormous hogsheads, ten feet high
and six broad. It would have been much
easier for him to drown himself in them
than to move them.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" shouted the giant. "Do
what I do and get the water."</p>

<p>"What's the good of that?" replied
Ned. "I'll go get the spring itself to put
in the pot," knowing that he could easily
run back to the king's castle for the little
magic nutshell.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said the giant, "that won't
do. You have already half spoiled my
forest with your Magic Axe. I don't want
you to take my spring away. You may
attend to the fire, and I'll go for the
water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>So the giant hung up the kettle, put
into it an ox cut into pieces, fifty cabbages,
and a wagon-load of carrots, skimming
the broth with a frying pan, tasting it
every now and then until it was done.
When everything was ready, he turned
and said:</p>

<p>"Now we'll see if you can do what I
can. I feel like eating the whole ox, and
you into the bargain. I think I'll serve
you for dessert."</p>

<p>"All right," answered little Ned. But
before sitting down he slipped his knapsack
under his jacket.</p>

<p>Then the two champions set to work.
Perhaps Ned was a trifle nervous, knowing
only too well that if he failed he must
be the giant's servant.</p>

<p>Well, the giant ate and ate, and Ned
wasn't idle; only he pitched everything,
beef, cabbage, carrots, and all, into his
knapsack when the giant wasn't looking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ouf!" at last grunted the giant, "I
can't do much more. I've got to undo the
lower button of my waistcoat."</p>

<p>"Eat away, starveling!" cried Ned,
sticking half a cabbage into his knapsack.</p>

<p>"Ouf!" groaned the giant, "I must
loosen another button. But what sort of
an ostrich's stomach have you got, Kiddo?
I should say you were used to eating
stones!"</p>

<p>"Eat away, lazy-bones!" said Ned,
sticking a huge chunk of beef into his
knapsack.</p>

<p>"Ouf!" sighed the giant for the third
time, "I must open the third button."</p>

<p>"Bah!" answered Ned. "It's the
easiest thing to relieve yourself," and taking
his knife, he slit his jacket and the
knapsack under it the whole length of his
stomach. "Now's your turn. Do as I do,
<i>if you can!</i>"</p>

<p>"Excuse me!" gasped the giant. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
win. I'd rather be your servant than do
that."</p>

<p>Then kissing Ned's hand in token of
submission, he lifted his little master on
his shoulder, and slinging the six bags
of gold over his back, started off through
the forest.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Ned, "I've forgotten
my Magic tools." So the giant
picked them up and thrusting them in his
pocket, again set off at a tremendous
rate.</p>

<p>After a while, they came in sight of a
great castle where lived a lord even more
wicked than the cruel Blue Beard. As
they drew nearer, they heard loud screams
like those of some fair lady in distress.
The next minute the wicked lord dragged
a lovely lady by the hair across the
courtyard.</p>

<p>With one stride the giant stepped over
the castle wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I toss him over the moon?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, leave him to me," replied Ned.
The wicked lord trembled and grew as
pale as a white swan that swam nearby
in a beautiful fountain.</p>

<p>"My giant servant at a sign from me,
will pitch you over the moon. But instead,
as you have the reputation of being
the greatest liar that ever lived, we will
see who can tell the biggest story, you or
I. If you lose, you shall give your castle
to this fair lady and take yourself off, I
don't care where, but you must never
return."</p>

<p>At once the wicked lord commenced to
tell the biggest story he could imagine.</p>

<p>"I have a bull so large that a man can
sit on each of his horns, and the two can't
touch each other with a twenty foot pole."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," replied Ned.
"At home on the farm we have a bull so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
large that a servant sitting on one of his
horns can't see the servant sitting on the
other."</p>

<p>"You win," laughed the pretty princess,
clapping her hands at Ned. Then the
wicked lord went to his stable and saddling
his best horse, rode away. But as
he passed through the gate, Ned touched
his steed with his magic gold ring. Instantly
the horse turned into an immense
bird and flew away. But where he went
no one knows to this day.</p>

<img src="images/i_089.png" width="400" height="252" alt="The Man with Ears like a Donkey invited Ned to eat with him." title="" />
</div>

<h2>MAGIC EARS</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Dear</span> me," said the giant suddenly.
"I've forgotten all about my errand.
You and your Magic Axe have robbed me
of my memory," and the big man
scratched his hand and looked anxiously
at Ned.</div>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I was to take a chicken to my old
mother," answered the giant sadly.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Ned. "I can take
care of myself. At any rate it is about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
time my friend the Gnome came back
to me."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said the giant.
"Here are your Magic Axe and your
Magic Pickaxe. I almost forgot them,"
and he set off at a great rate for his
mother's house.</p>

<p>Ned, too, quickened his pace, for it was
growing late, and the shadows creeping
from tree to tree. At length he saw a
light in the distance. It was a very little
light, not much larger than a star, and at
first Ned thought it might be a giant firefly.
However, he kept on and after a
while it turned out to be a little candle in
the window of a poor woodcutter's hut.
Knocking on the door, it was presently
opened by a strange looking man. He
had long hairy ears like a donkey and was
dressed in the skins of wild animals.</p>

<p>"Welcome," he said in a kindly voice,
"I am just preparing my evening meal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Come in and eat." Ned followed the
donkey-eared man into the cottage and sat
down at the rude wooden table on which
were spread black bread and beans.</p>

<p>"I have but humble fare to offer you,"
said the donkey-eared man, but his smile
was a kind one as he helped Ned to the
beans with a large wooden spoon. "But
as I see you are a traveler, you no doubt
have fared worse at times," and he smiled
again in such a friendly way, that Ned
took a great liking to him.</p>

<p>"You are right. I'm a traveler, seeking
adventures and many strange things
I have seen while visiting Gnomeland."</p>

<p>"I have heard little of the world since
my ears were changed into those of a donkey,"
sighed the donkey-eared man.</p>

<p>"Is there no magic charm which will
remove them?" asked Ned, as he finished
the last bean on his plate and wiped his
mouth carefully with the pocket handkerchief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
which his kind mother had given
him the very morning he had set out for
Gnomeland.</p>

<p>"None whatever," answered the man
with a sigh. "There is no charm nor
magic herb, but I've heard tell of a Magic
Axe that once cut down a charmed oak
tree overshadowing a king's palace. But
where am I to find that Magic Axe?"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh master dear, pray ask this lad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Your donkey ears to sever;</span><br />
For then your own two ears will take<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Their place as good as ever,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang a little bird from her tree in the
forest.</div>

<p>When Ned heard that, he jumped up
and went behind the door where he had
hung his knapsack. Taking out the
Magic Axe, he laid it on the table before
the donkey-eared man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cut off my ears!" shouted the donkey-eared
man.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," said Ned, trembling all
over.</p>

<p>"Do as I ask you," begged the donkey-eared
man, laying his head on the table.</p>

<p>Instead, however, Ned touched the donkey
ears with his little magic gold ring,
at the same time whispering, "Away with
you!"</p>

<p>Off went the long, hairy ears, and the
next minute, two grew in their place, just
like yours and mine.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, now I'm free from donkey ears,<br />
Three cheers and once, again, three cheers!<br />
No more the witch's evil snare<br />
Shall force me donkey ears to wear!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang the donkey-eared man, dancing
about the room.</div>

<p>All the next day Ned trudged on alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
until towards evening, he came to the
edge of a pine-forest, where close at hand
stood a small hut made of pine-branches,
plastered with mud and thatched with
rye-straw. No sooner had he tapped on
the door than it was opened by a girl.
She looked out timidly, thinking, I suppose,
it might be a robber. But when she
saw Ned, she smiled.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said, and Ned saw
four small children staring curiously at
him.</p>

<p>The room was very smoky, for there
was no chimney to the rude hut. A hole
in the roof let the smoke out, and there
were no windows, for the father of these
children was a poor peasant who made his
living by gathering turpentine in the pine
forest.</p>

<p>Ned sat down, while the girl went on
with her work until the black beans were
ready for supper, when she put them all in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a big wooden bowl, and invited Ned to
join her and the four children.</p>

<p>While they were eating out of the bowl
with a wooden spoon, a tame jackdaw who
had been sitting on an old stool by the fireside,
hopped over and perched himself
close to Ned.</p>

<p>When the supper was over, and the
children were ready for bed, he whispered,
"This little family is very poor. Their
father is away selling turpentine, and
there is little food in the cupboard. But
if you will come with me tonight, I will
show you how we can help them."</p>

<p>When all the children were sound
asleep, Ned looked over to the fireside
where the jackdaw sat, his eyes shining
brighter and brighter through the darkness,
till they made the room so light that
Ned could plainly see the five sleeping
children huddled together on the straw
bed in the corner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the jackdaw nodded, and hopping
down from the stool on which he sat,
walked softly over to the door.</p>

<p>The moon shone brightly on the bare
brown fields silvered with white frost, and
in the still, cold air, the forest looked like
a black cloud just dropped upon the
earth.</p>

<h2>THE MAGIC BASKET</h2>

<div class='center'>The Little Old Woman made a low bow to the Jackdaw.</div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_099.png" width="400" height="256" alt="The Little Old Woman made a low bow to the Jackdaw." title="" />
</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC BASKET</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">On</span> and on they went, the jackdaw hopping
over the rough fields, and now and
then turning his head and winking his
fiery eyes at Ned, until they found themselves
at the foot of a high, round hill.</div>

<p>At one side of the great mound the
stream which they had been following
suddenly stopped short, making a deep
well, over which hung an old oak tree,
leafless now, but still strewing the ground
with dry acorns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Right at the foot of this tree was an upright
gray stone, apparently part of a
rock deeply sunk in the hillside. Beside
this stone the jackdaw paused, and, turning
to nod reassuringly at Ned, picked up
a pebble about the size of an acorn and
dropped it into the well, at the same time
knocking gently on the flat stone with his
bill.</p>

<p>In a moment the rock opened in the
middle, and there stood a little old woman,
as withered as a spring apple and as
bright as a butterfly, dressed in a scarlet
bodice covered with spangles and a black
petticoat worked in square characters
with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Ned thought she was not nearly as attractive
as the fairies whom he had but
lately left, although she had on more
colors than even the Queen Fairy.</p>

<p>On seeing the jackdaw she made a low
bow, and in a shrill eager voice invited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
them in. Ned hesitated, but the little old
woman snatched his hand and pulled him
in, asking in a whisper, "Dost thou fear
for thyself when visiting the King of the
Gnomes?"</p>

<p>Then, opening a low door in the side of
the cavern, she beckoned them to follow.
In the middle of a still larger vault stood
an arm chair fashioned from beryl and
jasper, with knobs of amethyst and
topaz, in which sat Ned's friend, the
Gnome.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a robe of velvet,
green and soft as forest moss, and a ring
of gold lay on his grizzled hair. His little
eyes shone keen and fiery, and his hands,
withered and brown, were now covered
with glittering jewels.</p>

<p>About the cave a hundred little men,
smaller than he, were busy in a hundred
ways. Some stirred kettles of smoking
broth; others sliced fresh vegetables for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
crisp salads. Some spread a table, with
golden plates and crystal goblets; three
turned huge pieces of meat on a spit before
a fire at the end of the cavern, while
a dozen more watched the simmering
pots.</p>

<p>The jackdaw hopped gravely past all
this toward the chair of the Gnome King,
who stretched out his sceptre, a tall bulrush
of gold, and touched the jackdaw,
who at once turned into a dwarf.</p>

<p>Making a low bow to the Gnome King,
he turned to Ned and said:</p>

<p>"I was forced to take the form of a
jackdaw for twenty years because I once
said that gold was not as yellow as buttercups
nor so bright as sunshine. This
made the Gnomes angry, because their belief
is that gold is the most beautiful thing
in the world. My punishment is now
over and I need never return to the earth
again. But I would do a favor to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
poor peasant children who were so good
to me."</p>

<p>"What favor would you ask for the
poor peasant children?" asked the Gnome
King.</p>

<p>"I would send them a Magic Basket
filled with food," answered the dwarf.</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken, than the
Gnome ordered his subjects to fill a Magic
Basket with all kinds of good things to
eat. There was a golden bowl of smoking
stew, a crystal goblet of wine, a golden
dish of mashed potatoes and another of
rice pudding.</p>

<p>And when the Magic Basket was covered
with a damask napkin, it was handed
to a dwarf messenger to take to the poor
woodcutter's children, while all the little
dwarfs stood around him and sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"In this basket they will find<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Food and drink of magic kind.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never will it empty grow</span><br />
And no hunger they shall know."<br />
</div>

<p>"Hereafter," said the Gnome King,
looking kindly at Ned, "a bluebird shall
be your companion and will show you
many and curious things. I can spare no
more time, for my people must be governed,
and while I have given you more
attention than any other mortal because
of your great fondness for fairy tales, I
must now leave you in the care of this
bluebird, unless, perchance, you wish to
return to earth at once."</p>

<p>To which Ned answered eagerly that he
would much rather see more of Gnomeland
before again returning to the everyday
routine of grammar school and
lessons.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, then!" cried his
friend, as he shook Ned warmly by the
hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened and Ned once more
found himself by the side of the great flat
stone in the hillside, where rippling waters
of the little stream flowed into the
pool at the foot of the great oak tree, on
which sat a lovely bluebird.</p>

<p>Following the bluebird, Ned turned to
one side to avoid climbing the hill, and
continued his journey for some time,
keeping ever in sight the bluebird's beautiful
form.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when they were confronted
by a dense forest. This was not
particularly reassuring to Ned, especially
as the bluebird flew back and settled herself
on his shoulder, evidently not wishing
to enter the woods at so late an hour.
For in a deep, black forest, with all sorts
of strange shadows and ghostly trees, one
never knows what may be lurking about,
and the same Ned who, with his two stout
fists, in broad daylight would have undertaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to keep any living boy or man from
doing serious mischief, felt his teeth set
hard and his heart stand still as he came
into the shadow of the great trees.</p>

<p>The little bird nestled close to his cheek
and refused to leave his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ned, indeed, felt that he must now look
out for himself, and though his heart beat
high, he bravely trudged forward.</p>

<p>It was very unlike the woods to which
he had been accustomed to go with his
schoolmates at home, where bright green
maples, beeches and birches made a leafy
bower overhead. Instead, there were
solemn pines and hemlocks, and as he entered
deeper, great caverns appeared in
the rocks and narrow gulleys, into which
one might easily fall and break one's neck.</p>

<p>Through this dismal place he trudged
along, with his knees shaking, but with a
brave heart, until he came to a great pine,
which evidently had been struck by lightning,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for it stood up white and tall, lifting
its bare arms to the sky, like some specter
giant crying for vengeance.</p>

<p>Luckily he had placed the bluebird in
his pocket, fearing that the low hanging
branches would sweep it from his shoulders.
Had he not done so before arriving
at this spot the opportunity would not
have presented itself again.</p>

<p>Right at the foot of the pine, on a decaying
log, sat a little old man, who was
altogether the ugliest looking object that
Ned had ever seen. He was about half
the size of ordinary men, though the
whiteness of his hair and beard showed
plainly that he would never be any taller,
and though his body was short and
crooked to the last degree, his face was
long and pale, but was lighted up by wonderfully
brilliant eyes.</p>

<p>These were fixed on Ned from the moment
he came in sight, and, piercing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
through the darkness, it is no wonder that
they chilled the poor boy's blood and
failed to quicken his pace. Indeed, it is
not quite certain that he would have gone
forward at all if the greater part of the
forest had not been behind him, though
there seemed to be a spell in the strange
eyes that drew the boy on in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>"Come along! What are you afraid
of?" cried the dwarf in a little, dry voice,
that sounded like the cracking of a dry
twig beneath one's foot.</p>

<p>Ned hesitated, and, as if seeking the
comfort of something alive and friendly,
thrust his hand into his pocket alongside
of the little bluebird.</p>

<p>"Come on! Come on, little master," repeated
the dwarf. "Here I have been
waiting more than an hour to tell you
some good news, and now that you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
here you would hinder me because you are
such a coward."</p>

<p>"I don't know you," said Ned, as an
excuse.</p>

<p>"Well, well, no matter for that. I
know you well enough. Would you read
about gnomes and then be so cowardly
that you would fear to associate with
them?"</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, he arose, disclosing
a doorway in the trunk of the pine
tree behind him.</p>

<p>At that moment, a beautiful dwarf
maiden emerged therefrom, and, as if having
heard the conversation, said: "He is
no coward, father. See, he will shake
hands with me!"</p>

<p>Ned put out his hand, but drew it back
just in time to escape having the gold ring
which the Fairy Queen had given him,
slipped off his finger by the dwarf maiden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Selfish mortal," she cried, "'tis nothing
but a little gold band. Give it to me.
See, I will exchange this beautiful diamond
for it," and she held out a sparkling
stone set in a gold ring.</p>

<p>Ned drew back in alarm, more especially
as the dwarf himself advanced with
a threatening attitude.</p>

<p>Continuing to step back, Ned kept his
eyes upon the dwarf, who advanced now
with upraised fist. Seeing this, Ned
quickly threw off his coat and picking up
a stout stick, prepared to defend himself.</p>

<p>It would have gone ill with him, for the
dwarf was surprisingly strong and agile,
had not relief come from an unexpected
quarter.</p>

<span class="caption">NED THREW OFF HIS COAT.</span>
</div>

<p>The little bluebird had quietly slipped
out of Ned's pocket, and flying up to him,
received the gold ring about her neck in
accordance with the command of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Fairy Queen, which Ned remembered
suddenly and luckily in time.</p>

<p>Off flew the bird to the great tall pine
and touched it with the magic ring. In
an instant it changed into a giant, who
stretched forth one of his great hands,
and catching up the dwarf, hurled him
headlong down the side of the ravine
close by.</p>

<p>The dwarf maiden, with a cry, rushed
after him, climbing down the sides with
wonderful agility.</p>

<p>The giant now turned to Ned, saying:
"Little Master, I owe it to you that I am
once more my natural self. An evil spirit
transformed me into yonder tree, but the
magic of your ring has restored me once
more to my natural shape. I will henceforth
serve you while the occasion lasts,"
and with these words he knelt before Ned
most humbly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the bluebird handed
Ned his magic ring, and with this faithful
little friend, his gold ring, and the giant
for a servant, Ned felt that he had nothing
further to fear while traveling in
Gnomeland.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good friend," said
Ned, placing his hand upon the bowed
head of the giant. "You are certainly
grateful for what I have done for you,
which is more than can be said of many
mortals. But had I not had the magic
ring and the assistance of my little companion,
the bluebird, you would still be
the tree you were. Let us, therefore, the
three of us, pledge allegiance to one another
and set out upon our journey of
adventure."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking the giant arose
and carefully placing Ned upon his shoulder,
started off at a rapid stride.</p>

<p>The little bluebird flew ahead, and in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
short time the three comrades emerged
from the forest.</p>

<p>In the distance could be seen the turrets
of a stately castle, which looked down
from a high point of land upon a beautiful
river that wound in and out like a
silver ribbon through the meadow.</p>

<p>"Who lives in yonder castle?" asked
Ned, unconsciously adopting the style of
language of Gnomeland.</p>

<p>"I know not," answered the giant, "but
with a few more steps we will be able to
inquire at the postern gates."</p>

<p>It was indeed a stately castle, and upon
reaching the drawbridge Ned was surprised
to find that it was not lowered for
them to cross over, although they waited
for some time.</p>

<p>"I think I'll blow upon my policeman's
whistle," said Ned, hunting through his
pockets. "I certainly had it when I left
home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blow hard," advised the giant as Ned
brought it forth, "blow hard, that those
within may think us worthy of admittance."</p>

<p>Upon which Ned let out a blast that
would do justice to any Knight of the
Round Table. He was himself surprised
at the volume of sound, but was too much
interested in what was about to happen
to realize that the touch of his magic ring
had made it possible for the small nickel-plated
whistle to create such a sound.</p>

<p>Presently the drawbridge began slowly
to descend, and when the creaking chains
ceased their noise, our three comrades
crossed over to the castle gates. These
were thrown wide open, and just as the
giant placed Ned upon his feet in front
of the castle doors, they opened, disclosing
a beautiful princess on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Ned, to you and your two
friends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon the giant bowed very low,
and the little bluebird flew over and
nestled on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Ned was too delighted to speak for a
moment, for up to this time his experiences
had been most trying, but here at
last it seemed that fortune smiled upon
him.</p>

<p>So he and the giant followed her into
the stately hall, the latter finding it necessary
to stoop each time he entered a
doorway, for although the castle was built
on magnificent lines it had not occurred to
the architect that a giant would ever be
a guest.</p>

<p>When they were all seated, except the
giant, who sprawled on the floor, as
there was no chair large enough to accommodate
him, the beautiful princess
said:</p>

<p>"I would ask you to spend the night
here, but my wicked stepfather returns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
tonight, and I fear he will do you some
injury."</p>

<p>"I fear nothing," answered Ned courageously,
standing up to appear more
dignified, "and if I can be of any service
to you, say but a word, for I have a trusty
friend in the giant, and also a clever one
in my little bluebird, to say nothing of
the magic of this ring," and he touched
the gold band about his finger and bowed
again to the beautiful princess.</p>

<p>"My stepfather is very crafty," said
the princess, looking at Ned intently, as
if weighing the possibilities of his assistance.
"He once changed a giant into a
pine tree!" At these words, the giant
began to shake and tremble so that the cut
glass chandeliers rattled all over the
castle.</p>

<p>"Remember, I have the magic ring,"
Ned whispered, leaning over to where the
giant lay upon the floor; "nothing can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
harm us with that in our possession."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" asked
Ned, turning again to the beautiful
princess, for he felt that she was unwilling
to ask him the favor, fearing it might
prove of harm to him.</p>

<p>Still the beautiful princess remained
silent until the bluebird began to sing a
sweet song, perching meanwhile upon her
shoulder, as if intending the song for her
ears especially.</p>

<p>Then tears fell from her eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tis the song my brother was wont
to sing," she said, "but now"&mdash;and hiding
her face in her hands, she wept more
bitterly than before&mdash;"he has been sent
away and hidden by my cruel stepfather
I know not where."</p>

<p>"We will find him for you, princess,"
cried Ned. "Fear not, for I have confidence
in my two comrades and in myself.
Give us all something to eat that we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
have strength to undertake this adventure."</p>

<p>The princess immediately ordered a
great feast to be set before them, and
when our three comrades had eaten their
fill they once more set out upon their journey,
with the prayers of the beautiful
princess for their safety and successful
return.</p>

<p>As they wound their way through the
pleasant valley, every so often the little
bluebird would sing her song, loud and
sweet, and then would pause, with folded
wing, to listen, as if expecting an answer.</p>

<p>So they went on for many miles, until,
as they approached a cottage by the roadside,
Ned thought he heard a familiar air.
Indeed, he was sure that something important
was about to happen, for the
bluebird was whirring around in circles
and singing as if her life depended upon
the way she trilled and warbled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, there is a bluebird in that
wicker cage!" exclaimed Ned, pointing
toward the cottage porch, from which
swung a bird cage.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, true, and in another moment
Ned's bluebird was perched on the
railing close by.</p>

<p>Scrambling down from the giant's
friendly shoulder, Ned touched the cage,
and, to his amazement, the little door flew
open and out walked a handsome young
prince, about his own age.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" cried Ned, but before
he could reply the giant exclaimed: "He
must be the brother of the princess! We
have, indeed, completed our adventure, or
nearly so," he added, remembering they
had yet to deal with the crafty stepfather.</p>

<p>"How can I ever repay you?" cried the
little prince, who was at first unable to
speak from the joy of it all. "I am free!
I am free!" And he almost cried with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
delight, flinging his arms about Ned's
sturdy form and patting the leg of the
giant.</p>

<p>"Come, little bluebird, and let me
thank you, too," he added, as the pretty
bird circled in the air and alighted on
Ned's shoulder. Indeed, it was a happy
moment for all.</p>

<p>"And now," said Ned, "let us think of
the best way to return to the castle, so
that the princess may receive her long-lost
brother."</p>

<p>"The easiest way is the best way," said
the giant. "Both you boys climb up on
my back, and in 500 short seconds we'll
be back at the castle, or I have forgotten
my early training on the cinder path."</p>

<p>All of which goes to show that even in
Gnomeland there are sports, although few
fairy tales tell us anything about them.</p>

<p>When Ned and the prince had seated
themselves comfortably on the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
shoulders of the obliging giant, he set off
at a tremendous rate, and soon they were
ascending the hill on which stood the castle
of the beautiful princess.</p>

</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC RING</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Ned</span> followed the beautiful princess and
her brother into the castle, while the giant,
who had to stoop nearly to the floor in
order to enter the doorway, brought up
the rear.</div>

<p>As it was late, everyone decided to go
to bed. Besides, they were all well tired
out after their exciting day.</p>

<p>You would have laughed to see the giant
ascend the stairway to the royal bedchambers,
for the steps were too small for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
feet, and it was with great difficulty that
he managed to get a foothold with the
toes of his boots.</p>

<p>When at last he was safely inside his
bedroom, the largest in the castle, it was
found that the bedstead was not nearly
long enough for him.</p>

<p>So the princess gave orders that two cot
beds be placed ends together, and in this
way the giant, by allowing his feet to project
through the open window, could lie
down at full length. His feet nearly
reached the tree that grew just outside,
on which the little bluebird had perched
for the night, and it was lucky, indeed,
that it was midsummer, for otherwise our
big friend might have caught a severe
cold.</p>

<p>After bidding the giant goodnight the
little bluebird had a few minutes' talk
with Ned while he undressed himself.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i_129.png" width="365" height="500" alt="THE STEPS WERE TOO SMALL FOR THE GIANT." title="THE STEPS WERE TOO SMALL FOR THE GIANT." />
<span class="caption">THE STEPS WERE TOO SMALL FOR THE GIANT.</span>
</div>

<p>She agreed to act as sentinel during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
night, to keep a vigilant lookout from the
treetop, and in case of approaching danger
instantly to awaken Ned and the
giant.</p>

<p>Gradually the great castle grew quiet,
until nothing was stirring, "not even a
mouse."</p>

<p>At times the night wind rustled the
leaves in the tree where the little bluebird
sentinel sat winking and blinking, and the
big yellow moon glistened fantastically on
the big toe of the giant.</p>

<p>Toward midnight a faint sound in the
distance, like the beat of horses' hoofs,
startled the bluebird.</p>

<p>Hastily flying toward the castle entrance
she gazed out upon the roadway
that wound up from the valley below.</p>

<p>At some distance she made out dimly
the figures of a number of horsemen.</p>

<p>Returning swiftly to the castle, she
tweaked the giant's big toe. That, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
can easily imagine, awoke him with a
start.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked in a
frightened whisper which, although only
a whisper, was enough to make the castle
tremble, thereby awakening Ned and the
princess herself.</p>

<p>"The crafty stepfather of the princess
is coming," answered the bluebird.</p>

<p>"Then it's all up with me," cried the
giant, "for he'll change me again into a
pine tree."</p>

<p>The bluebird made no reply, but hastened
to find Ned. On entering his bedroom
through the half open window she
found him already dressing. "Take the
ring," he said, slipping it over her glossy
neck, after she had informed him of what
she had seen. "If you can manage to
touch him with it, this wicked man will
find that he has no power whatever to
harm us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will make haste," replied the little
bird, "for they must by this time have
reached the drawbridge."</p>

<p>So saying she flew swiftly away and
reached the other side of the moat just as
the cavalcade set foot upon the bridge.</p>

<p>Awaiting her opportunity to touch the
wicked stepfather of the princess with the
magic ring, she alighted quietly on the
tip of a spear which one of the horsemen
carried.</p>

<p>As they neared the center of the drawbridge
the king, as if suddenly aware of
an unseen power, exclaimed: "I feel
there is danger near!"</p>

<p>Then the horseman shook his spear defiantly
and so startled the little bluebird
that she nearly lost her footing, and alas!
what was much more serious, caused her
to loosen her hold upon the little magic
gold ring, which slipped from between her
bill and fell into the waters of the moat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a falling star, it shivered and glimmered
in the rays of the moon as it descended,
attracting the attention of a
speckled trout, who opened his mouth and
swallowed it as it splashed upon the silvery
surface of the water.</p>

<p>"Your trusty spear has done me good
service in times gone by," exclaimed the
wicked king, not knowing that its owner
had unknowingly been the cause of saving
him at the present moment.</p>

<p>On came the cavalcade, the wicked attendants
of the king inside the castle
opening the gates and allowing him and
his men to enter the courtyard.</p>

<p>Ned looked down from his window and
wondered what had become of the bluebird.
He did not feel afraid, but at the
same time he realized that he was not in
friendly hands. The giant, on hearing
the gates open, had quickly drawn in
his feet and was struggling to get his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
shoes on when Ned appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"It's all up!" said the big fellow, with
a wry face and a catch in his gruff voice.
"I can feel already the pine-needles beginning
to stick out all over me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's gooseflesh, you're so
scared!" replied Ned, smiling in spite of
the gravity of the situation. "It may not
be as bad as you think!"</p>

<p>Just then a great pounding on the front
doors told them that the King was seeking
admittance. "Who has locked the
doors?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the sweet voice
of the princess; "we did not expect you
so late," and she ran down the stairs and
opened the door herself.</p>

<p>"I have two visitors upstairs," she said,
as the angry monarch stepped inside.</p>

<p>"What!" he shouted hoarsely, "bring
them to me. How do I know but that
they are enemies?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed they are not," she replied, "as
you will see in 500 short seconds."</p>

<p>"Ned, come down!" she called, "bring
your friend with you, for I would have
you meet the King!"</p>

<p>Ned turned to the giant, whose big face
was twitching with terror. "He'll recognize
me as sure as eggs is eggs!" he
groaned.</p>

<p>"What! is that thunder?" exclaimed
the King below, mistaking the giant's
moan for a thunderclap, but before his
question was answered Ned and his friend
appeared at the head of the stairway.</p>

<p>After shaking hands with Ned in quite
a friendly way the wicked King turned to
the giant. "Ha, ha!" he cried, "have I
not had the pleasure of meeting you before,
my fine friend?"</p>

<p>The giant said nothing, for what could
he say?</p>

<p>"Have I not met you before?" repeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the King, with a fierce gesture. "Methinks
you would look better as a pine tree
than a hulking giant," and before the
words were fairly out of the King's mouth
a stately pine tree was standing in the
courtyard, through which the wind of the
early morning made a moaning noise
much like the pitiful groan of the poor,
late giant.</p>

<p>"And you, my little cockatoo," continued
the wicked King, turning quickly to
Ned, "would look better in a cage!"</p>

<p>And in another minute Ned found himself
in a wicker cage, suspended from the
lowest limb of the pine tree.</p>

<p>"And now," cried the wicked King,
"where is your third guest?" The princess
paused a moment. "Oh, the little
bluebird!" she exclaimed, "where has it
gone?"</p>

<p>"No, not the little bluebird, but he that
was the bluebird."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>At this the poor princess became very
pale. She had hidden her brother the
evening before when they had gone to bed
in a closet in her room, hoping to have
the opportunity of disguising him and
sending him away with Ned and the giant
the first thing in the morning. But, now,
alas, her wicked stepfather undoubtedly
suspected something. For else why
should he ask for him?</p>

<p>She was in despair, for she knew not
what to say. And where was Ned's little
friend, the bluebird herself, all this time?
Had she deserted her friends, the little
princess asked herself?</p>

<p>"Answer my question!" cried the
King, grasping hold of her wrist.</p>

<p>The princess screamed with terror and
her brother, hearing her cry, rushed forth
from the closet and down the stairs.</p>

<p>Whipping his sword from its scabbard,
he made for the cruel tyrant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas, that bravery and valor do not always
win! It was useless for him to fight
against so experienced a swordsman as
the King, and in short time the prince
was wounded and his sword thrown from
his grasp.</p>

<p>"Little gamecock!" cried his conqueror,
"you must needs grow larger
spurs before you tackle an old rooster like
me! And since you remind me of one,
a rooster you shall be," and in five short
seconds the little prince was changed into
a young gamecock.</p>

<p>"Out into the courtyard!" cried the
King; "a castle is no chicken house," and
the little prince found himself unceremoniously
thrown under the big pine tree.</p>

<p>"Have pity!" cried the little princess.
"Is there no pity for a little orphan
princess?"</p>

<p>"Enough," answered the King, with a
stamp of his foot. "Go to your room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
else you may find yourself also changed
into a bird, or a tree, or a pretty
butterfly."</p>

<p>So the unhappy little princess went up
the stairs, crying bitterly, to her own
chamber. Closing the door, she leaned
out of the window and sobbed as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>For a moment she did not notice that
the topmost branch of the pine tree was
close to her casement. In fact, she would
not have noticed it for some time probably,
as her face was buried in her hands,
had not the branch brushed against her
fingers.</p>

<p>As she withdrew her hands from her
face she heard the giant's voice, very
much subdued, speaking to her.</p>

<p>"Ned says not to despair, for he feels
sure that his little friend, the bluebird,
will yet find a way to liberate us all."</p>

</div>

<h2>THE MAGIC BALLOON</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Great</span> was the grief of the little bluebird
as she skimmed over the waters of the
moat, realizing how impossible it was for
her to regain the lost ring.</div>

<p>She had not the heart for the moment
to return to the castle to inform Ned of
his loss; so she perched herself disconsolately
on a bush which grew close to the
margin of the moon-lit water, wondering
what was best to do.</p>

<p>Suddenly the speckled trout rose to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the surface, and, seeing how despondent
was the pretty bluebird, inquired the
cause of her grief.</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" she sighed in answer. "I
have lost a magic gold ring, and I know
not what to do, nor how to recover it."</p>

<p>At this the speckled trout flapped his
silvery tail gleefully, and answered:
"Worry no more, pretty bluebird, for I
have it safely tucked away inside of me."</p>

<p>"If that be the case, Sir Trout," joyously
chirped the happy bird, "swim at
your greatest speed and deliver the ring
to her majesty, the Waterfall Fairy,
Queen of the Lake. Tell her that Ned,
her little mortal friend, is in dire peril
and that he needs her aid."</p>

<p>"That will I gladly do," answered the
speckled trout, and without more delay
he darted off down the moat toward the
dam at the farther side, over which the
water ran in a clear stream into the purling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
brook, which finally led to the lake,
where lived Ned's friend, the Fairy
Queen. Down the silvery cascade he
glided and whirled away through the running
water, frightening the minnows and
miller's thumbs lying among the stones
in the shallow places, and startling the
crawfishes and little fresh water lobsters
hidden under the hollow banks.</p>

<p>Faster and faster he swam, like a courier
with important dispatches, down the
clear stream running over its pebbly bed,
with the luscious meadow sweet and the
large blue geranium blooming all about its
banks, and the wild rose on its bushes.</p>

<p>Nor did he pause until with a loud
splash he dived over the waterfall safely
into the lake and rose to the surface close
to the palace of the Queen of the Lake.</p>

<p>A big black spider was busily at work
mending the suspension bridge which
spanned the water at this narrow point,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for the heavy drops of dew had broken
the slender strands in several places.</p>

<p>He stopped his work to look at the
speckled trout, who at once addressed
him.</p>

<p>"I am the bearer of a most important
dispatch for her highness," he began.</p>

<p>"Well, and I am engaged in the most
important duty of repairing her highness'
bridge," replied the spider.</p>

<p>"So, I see," answered the trout, "but&mdash;&mdash;"
At this very moment the Queen herself,
hearing voices at so early an hour
outside her window, peeped out. Catching
sight of her the trout called out
boldly:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, I beg of you, most gracious
Queen. I have brought you the
gold ring from Ned, who sorely needs thy
aid!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i_147.png" width="355" height="500" alt="&quot;HERE IS THE RING,&quot; SAID THE TROUT." title="&quot;HERE IS THE RING,&quot; SAID THE TROUT." />
<span class="caption">&quot;HERE IS THE RING,&quot; SAID THE TROUT.</span>
</div>

<p>At this the Queen quickly withdrew her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
head, and in a short time emerged from
the doorway of her castle.</p>

<p>Hastily running to the water's edge,
she leaned over, grasping hold of a stalk
to keep her from falling.</p>

<p>"Here is the ring," said the trout, holding
it in his teeth and swimming as close
to the bank as he was able.</p>

<p>The Queen reached out and took it
safely from him.</p>

<p>"I will make you king of my fishes,
noble Sir Trout," she cried, "for what
you have this day accomplished. Remain
here in my lake henceforth, and now, to
the rescue!"</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time she was
mounted on her swiftest robin and with
her three ladies in waiting flew away toward
the castle, where Ned and the beautiful
princess, her brave brother and the
giant were held prisoners by the magic
of the wicked king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the little bluebird, as she saw her
friend, the trout, swim away, suddenly
thought of her former master, the King
of the Gnomes, and decided to seek aid
from him. So, whirling around in a circle
to get her bearings, she darted off
swiftly through the air toward the cave
in the forest.</p>

<p>She made rapid progress until she
reached the thick foliage of the woods,
and here, in her eagerness, she nearly lost
her way.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the uncertain light that
struggled through the thick boughs, it
was not easy to make out certain familiar
landmarks which would guide her to her
destination.</p>

<p>At length, just at dawn, she found herself
at the foot of the hill wherein was
the cave of the King of the Gnomes.</p>

<p>Worn out with her arduous journey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
she fluttered down to the edge of the bubbling
fountain and drank of its refreshing
waters.</p>

<p>Then, picking up a pebble, she dropped
it into the little gravelly basin, hopped
painfully over to the great flat stone, and
tapped upon it three times with her beak.</p>

<p>No one replied, but the rock opened in
the middle, and there stood the King of
the Gnomes himself.</p>

<p>On seeing the little bluebird, he
stretched out a kindly hand for her to rest
upon, and carried her into the inner room.</p>

<p>It was his breakfast hour, for gnomes
are early risers. Seating himself at the
table, he ordered that the little bird be
served with breakfast at once, for well he
knew that a hungry bird's first wish must
be for food.</p>

<p>The King had scarce given this order
before several nimble little men of the forest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
placed seeds and grains of wheat and
a goblet of golden fruit juice before the
bluebird.</p>

<p>Soon she was sufficiently revived to address
the gnomes, and it took her but a
few moments to tell him all.</p>

<p>"Come, let us hasten," he said, as she
finished, and, slipping into his pocket his
magic pipe and little pieces of soap, he
left the cave and walked rapidly toward
a small clearing.</p>

<p>Leaning over a little pool in the hollow
of the grassy earth, he filled his pipe,
rubbed the soap about the rim, and in a
moment more blew a large soap bubble.</p>

<p>Taking the little bluebird in his hand,
he opened a small door and entered the
magic balloon. Up and up it went, until
it was well above the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>Then it took a course toward the east,
where the rising sun was gilding the sky
with its golden fingers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Faster and faster it sailed, overtaking
in a short time the Fairy Queen and her
three ladies-in-waiting, mounted on their
friendly robins.</p>

<p>In the distance could be seen the turrets
of the castle, gleaming in the morning sun
like bayonets thrust up from the earth
in monster guns.</p>

<p>"Now, little bluebird," said the Gnome,
opening the little door and thrusting her
out upon his hand, as the big Soap Bubble
hovered above the castle, "fly down
and tell Ned that deliverance is near at
hand. So also inform the beautiful
Princess, who, I see, is still sitting at her
window, but asleep!"</p>

<p>Off flew the bluebird on her happy
errand.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," cried the Gnome, addressing
the Fairy Queen, as she drew
rein at the doorway of the soap bubble,
"I would suggest that you touch with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Magic Ring only the cage wherein is confined
our friend Ned, instructing him,
while still in the form of a cockatoo, to
fly up to the topmost branch of the pine
tree. Also for the Princess' brother,
while he is still a gamecock, to do likewise.
After I have brought the bubble
close to the window ledge, so that the
beautiful Princess may step easily inside,
I will cause it to rise to the treetop, from
which advantageous position Ned and the
Princess' brother can step within. But
what to do with the Pine Tree Giant,"
said the Gnome, scratching his beard reflectively,
"gets me! However, one thing
at a time, as my old grandfather used to
say when I was a boy, 'one thing at a
time!'"</p>

<p>As the bluebird whispered in the ear of
the beautiful Princess, the Magic Soap
Bubble approached the window ledge.</p>

<p>Rubbing her eyes, but making no outcry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
although she was very much startled,
she obeyed the bluebird's command to
"step softly," and entered the Bubble.
It then ascended till it was on a line with
the topmost branch, where it swayed in
the gentle morning breeze, like a barnyard
weather cock, the game rooster on
one side and the cockatoo on the other!</p>

<p>The Fairy Queen touched them with the
ring as they hopped into the bubble, and
they regained immediately their natural
shape.</p>

<p>The Princess threw her arms around
her dear brother and hugged Ned, so
great was her delight.</p>

<p>Ned ran over to his little friend, the
Gnome, and thanked him again and again
for his aid, and was about to lean out of
the doorway to also thank the Fairy
Queen when the Gnome restrained him.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Ned, my boy! All is not
yet over."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered Ned, "we must
rescue the giant."</p>

<p>"Aye, there's the rub," replied the
Gnome. "How are we ever to get him in
the bubble, either as a tree or as a giant?"</p>

<p>At this point the Fairy Queen joined in
the conversation, kissing Ned at the same
time as he attempted to thank her.</p>

<p>"Let me first change him into his natural
form," she said. "Then he can walk
across the courtyard and out upon the
drawbridge. From there he can easily
step off into the bubble, which your majesty
can lower to the right height above
the water of the moat."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Gnome. "Go and do
your part and I will attend to the bubble."</p>

<p>Just as the bubble cleared it the pine
tree became once more the friendly giant,
who immediately strode across the courtyard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly lowering the drawbridge he
hastened out upon it.</p>

<p>The creaking of the chains, however,
had aroused the wicked King, who looked
out of his window to see what was the
cause of the noise. In another moment
he was rushing toward the gates at the
head of the castle guard.</p>

<p>"Quick!" shouted the Gnome to the
giant. "Get in!"</p>

<p>But, alas! The doorway was too small.
In vain the giant wiggled and squirmed.
In vain Ned and the princess' brother
pulled his arms. His great shoulders
could not be forced through the doorway.
Finally, with a tremendous shove he managed
to go half way in, but no further,
for at this point his head was against the
opposite side of the bubble.</p>

<p>On came the wicked King and his castle
attendants, who, seeing the predicament<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of the giant, fitted arrows to their strong
bows, preparing to shoot the hapless
fellow.</p>

<p>"Blow the bubble larger!" shouted Ned.
"Put the pipe in his mouth and tell him
to blow like thunder."</p>

<p>The Gnome placed the pipestem between
the lips of the giant and commanded
him to blow for his life, and before
an arrow left a bow the bubble
widened sufficiently to enable the giant to
crawl inside. Slamming the door shut
the Gnome cried out exultingly: "We
are safe!"</p>

<p>Away sailed the Magic Soap Bubble,
with the Fairy Queen and her little robin
perched securely on the top, and her three
ladies in waiting standing close by on
their own little feathered steeds.</p>

<p>Back to the beautiful Waterfall Lake,
where the Fairy Queen bade Ned goodby;
back to the friendly Gnome's cave in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
woods, where he said farewell to Ned;
back to Big Man's Land, where lived the
Giant with his kind old mother; back to
the castle where lived the beautiful
Princess and her brother before the
wicked King had kidnapped them, and
back at last to Ned's own home, where it
left him in the old easy chair by the window,
from which he had started out to
visit Gnomeland.</p>

<p>Well, well, little reader, here we are,
you and I, at the end of the book. What
shall we do, for we have grown to be such
good friends while you have been reading
this story of mine.</p>

<p>Listen, I will tell you another story,

one of The Little Journeys to Happyland

<h2>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS<br />
SERIES</h2>

<h3>By LILLIAN ELIZABETH ROY</h3>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class='center'>
Handsomely Bound. Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.<br />
For Children 6 to 12 Years<br />
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This series presents early American history in a manner
that impresses the young readers. Because of George and
Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the
famous General Washington, these stories follow exactly
the life of the great American, by means of playing they
act the life of the Washingtons, both in battles and in
society.</p>


<p>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS</p>

<p>Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in "punishment"
lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the "Life of Washington." The culprits
listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further
games of Indian warfare and Colonists' battles.</p>


<p>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS RELATIVES</p>

<p>The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games
of playing General Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim
almost loses his scalp.</p>


<p>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' TRAVELS</p>

<p>The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York
City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons
vanquish the Hessians on a battle-field in the empty lot back of
the Davis property.</p>


<p>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL</p>

<p>After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies
camping near the back road to their homes and incidentally they secure
the stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from the "butter and egg
farmer" of the Parkes.</p>


<p>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' HOLIDAYS</p>

<p>They spend a pleasant summer on two adjoining farms in Vermont.
During the voyage they try to capture a "frigate" but little Jim is caught
and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates hasten in
and save him.</p>
